I am a PhD candidate at the Paris Saclay University ([Acoustic communications team](https://www.cb.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), NeuroPSI) and the University of Antananarivo (Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity). My research interests include Bioacoustics, Ethology, Cognitive Science, Marine Biology, Conservation, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning. I am familiar with marine and terrestrial fieldwork, data analysis, and developing and implementing research tools. My current research project involves studying humpback whale mother-calf pairs' behaviors in the Sainte Marie channel, Madagascar, to understand mother-young interactions better.

My work and research on humpback whales
====

I started to work on humpback whales in 2018 for my Master's degree. During this time, I began to use animal-borne multi-sensor tags to study the swimming behavior of humpback whale mother-calf pairs in Sainte Marie, Madagascar. My emerging curiosity regarding biologging's use for studying whales led to my PhD project. My PhD project involves using animal-borne multi-sensor tags (CATS cam tags and Acousonde tags) to study the nursing behavior, the swimming behavior, and the acoustic communication in humpback whale mother-calf pairs on their calving ground. My latest work addressed how to use Machine Learning to study nursing behavior when visual cues are unavailable. Currently, I work on source identification in tag data, contexts of mother-calf pairs' vocalizations, and the swimming strategies used by mother-calf pairs.
