I am currently affiliated with the Paris Saclay University ([Acoustic communications team](https://www.cb.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), NeuroPSI) and the University of Antananarivo (Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity). My research interests include Bioacoustics, Ethology, Cognitive Science, Marine Biology, Conservation, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning. I am familiar with marine and terrestrial fieldwork, data analysis, and developing and implementing research tools. My current research project involves studying humpback whale mother-calf pairs' behaviors in the Sainte Marie channel, Madagascar, to understand mammalian mother-young interactions better in an aquatic context.

My work and research on humpback whales
====

I started to closely work on humpback whales in 2018 for my Master's degree. During this time, I started to use animal-borne multi-sensor tags to study the swimming behavior of humpback whale mother-calf pairs in Sainte Marie, Madagascar. My emerging curiosity regarding biologging's use for studying whales led to my Ph.D. project. My Ph.D. project involved using animal-borne multi-sensor tags (CATS cam tags and Acousonde tags) to study the nursing/suckling behavior, the swimming behavior, and the acoustic communication in humpback whale mother-calf pairs on their calving ground. I developed an automatic detection method for studying suckling behavior using accelerometry data and described the suckling modalities, the temporal pattern, the laterality, and the spatial and behavioral context. In addition, I studied the swimming behavior of the calves and their mothers to investigate how their activities unwind with age and how the mothers help the calves in their complex 3D environment. Finally, I examined the vocalizations and their biological functions. I was able to associate previously described calls with well-defined contexts and hypothesize on their biological functions. For instance, I provided the first robust evidence pointing toward the begging calls used by humpback whale calves.
