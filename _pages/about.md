I am a PhD candidate at the Paris Saclay University ([Acoustic communications team](https://www.cb.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), NeuroPSI) and the University of Antananarivo (Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity). My current research project involves studying humpback whale mother-calf pairs' behaviors in the Sainte Marie channel, Madagascar, to better understand mother-young interactions. I am familiar with project design and management, marine and terrestrial fieldworks, data analysis and interpretation, and the development and implementation of research tools.
